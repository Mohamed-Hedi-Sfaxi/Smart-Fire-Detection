## Title of the project:

Smart Fire Detection </br>

## Description:

Our system's goal is to make the house more secure, </br>
by mainly fighting against all types of leaks and flames, </br>
using a fire management model based on three </br>
alert levels. </br>



## Objective:

The development of a fire-fighting tool </br> 
that is based on IoT and linked to a mobile application </br>
which allows the management of the system. </br>

List of devices: </br>
Arduino , ESP8622 , RaspBerry Pi 4 , Sensor MH , MQ7,  Raspberry camera </br>

## Installation and prepartion instrcutions:
